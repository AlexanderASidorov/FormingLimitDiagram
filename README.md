This code is based on the following publication: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2012.11.022 .\
To quickly obtain the main results, you can use the FLD.ipynb notebook: just define your own A80 (in the transverse direction), r0, r45, r90, t and A80min (if it is not equal to A80) and that's all.\
However, more advanced and flexible options are available in the FLD.py file.
